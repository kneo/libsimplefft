libsimplefft
---------------------

This library is designed to run as fast as possible.
Several optimization are implemented by default.
This implementation uses the Radix 2 decimation in frequency Fast Fourier Transform (Radix 2 DIF FFT).
Its an inplace computation using precomputed twiddle factors.

What's working
---------------------
- for now single precision fft works fine

What's going to work?
----------------------
- ifft is not implemented by now but will be available soon as well
- JNI interface for java access is going to be implemented
- Android build targed is scheduled as well
- bit reversal is going to be cached
- further low latency optimations are going to be made
